<p class ="took">As the little prince dropped off to sleep,
    I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
    I felt deeply moved, and stirred.
It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.
    It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more
    fragile on all Erth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair
    that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: "What I see
    here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."
    As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: "What moves me so deeply,
    about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through
    his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . ." And I felt him to be more fragile still.
    I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .</p>
